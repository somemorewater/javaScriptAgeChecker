# JavaScript Profile Form

This project demonstrates the use of JavaScript to create an interactive profile form that collects user data, calculates age, and displays a personalized greeting and information. The focus of this project is on **JavaScript functionality**, with a bit of styling to make the form visually appealing.

## Features

- **User Input**: Collects the user's first name, last name, and date of birth.
- **Age Calculation**: Calculates the user's age based on their date of birth and displays it.
- **Dynamic Greetings**: Displays a personalized greeting message using the user's first name.
- **Styled Output**: Adds some basic styling to ensure the profile page isn't plain, enhancing user experience.

## How It Works

1. **Form Submission**: When the user fills out the form and submits it, JavaScript prevents the default form submission and processes the input data.
2. **Greeting**: The user's first name is used to generate a custom greeting message, which is displayed on the page.
3. **Full Name**: The user's full name is displayed in uppercase.
4. **Age Calculation**: The user's age is calculated based on the date of birth, adjusting for whether the user has had their birthday yet this year.
5. **Profile Display**: After the form is submitted, the form is hidden, and the profile information is displayed in a new section.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure of the form and profile page.
- **CSS**: For minimal styling to enhance the visual presentation of the profile page.
- **JavaScript**: The core of the project, handling form submission, greeting generation, and age calculation.
